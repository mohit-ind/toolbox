# Package statik

The file(s) in the package are generated by [rakyll's statik](https://github.com/rakyll/statik) during the build, do not edit them by hand!

Also do not commit changes in this package, what is in right now is a placeholder item. The real content will go into the application binary in this way:
- the `statik -f -src=sql-migration-scripts` command will take all file from sql-migration-scripts
- bundle them together as a Go string and put it into this package
- then `go build` will be called and the migrations scripts will be built into the output binary file

Use `make build` from the root directory of this example to re-generate the statik files
